Hi! I'm Abel. I'm a 18yo student from Colombia learning about programming. I'm currently studying engineering in college.
I'm learning anything about programming and computer science. I find it really fun and would like to do more serious projects in the future.
I'm looking to collaborate on anything I could help with. It would be really good if I start collaborating on more serious projects because I feel like I'm prepared and would be glad to help.
Ask me about anything you need! I always have some free time and would probably respond very quick.
